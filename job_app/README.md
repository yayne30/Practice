Example structure for a job listing:

Copy code
export const jobs = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Software Engineer",
    description: "Develop and maintain web applications...",
    responsibilities: ["Write clean code", "Collaborate with team members"],
    ideal_candidate: {
      age: "25-35 years",
      gender: "Any",
      traits: ["Team player", "Proactive", "Good communication skills"],
    },
    about: {
      posted_on: "August 1, 2024",
